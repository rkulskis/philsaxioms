    title: An external world exists
    description: Given that our senses are generally reliable and we observe
      consistent patterns, there exists a world of material objects external to
      our minds.
    conclusion: Material reality exists independently of our consciousness

    title: Causal series exist in nature

    title: A first cause is necessary
    description: Since infinite regress of causes is impossible, there must be a
